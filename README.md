NAVDTU is a cutting-edge project that aims to simplify navigation within the Delhi Technological University (DTU) campus by leveraging the power of Dijkstra's algorithm. This project offers a user-friendly interface through which users can input their desired source and destination points within the campus, and the system will dynamically calculate the shortest path between them.

Using graph-based representations of the DTU campus map, the project efficiently applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most optimal route based on distance and connectivity. The algorithm considers various factors such as road networks, building layouts, and one-way paths to determine the shortest path and provide step-by-step directions to the users.

NAVDTU not only saves time and effort for students, faculty, and visitors navigating the vast campus but also enhances safety and convenience. By providing accurate and reliable directions, this project aims to enhance the overall campus experience and ensure efficient movement between different locations within DTU.

With its intuitive interface and robust implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, NAVDTU revolutionizes navigation on the DTU campus, providing an invaluable tool for efficient and seamless travel between different points of interest.
